# humansystems

## Motivation:
Most of humanity's systems and frameworks have always geared towards taking the perfect action given a certain input. These allow humans to take calculated, as close to opitmal decisions as we can get in controlled environments. This approach is excellent for high risk applications such as space expeditions, surgery, chemical experimentation, software developement, etc. Where this apporach is tested, however, is in the real world. Where many variables and human limitations often prevent us from making the most optimal choices. This also creates confusion in terms of morality and justice. This project arises from the need to establish a set of dynamic, abstract, empathetic, and reasonable standards for the desicion making everyday humans face in every day situations. 

## Vision:
Establishing a human first relational system for best practices on living a healthy life.

## Mission:
To create a new standard for educating about the human experience, in order to minizmize harm to others and the world around them and increase joy, productivity .

## Engineering Goal:
Compile best human practices in order to define a flexible multivariate relational system for descision making, with sturctured relationships between commonly related desicions.

## What this knowledge base is:
 - Best practices to set yourself up for success
 - Best practices to bring joy to yourself
 - Best practices to support those around you
 - High level abstract concepts that encompass lower level science

## What this knowledge base isn't:
 - A set of laws
 - A set of moral principles
 - A religion
 - A comphrensive list of every specific situation a person can face
 - A rote for rote guide for living the most opitmal life
 - Specific science, moral, philosphical, or judicial concepts
